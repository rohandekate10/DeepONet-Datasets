    "The LAMP-based problem aims to efficiently estimate the VBM (vertical bending moment) statistics of a unique ship, the ONR topsides flare variant, to inform future design decisions. This real-life industrial application brings significant complexity and numerous challenges. These are documented at length in Guth and Sapsis (2022) [9] and we strongly refer the reader to the above paper as we closely follow their implementation. Briefly, we describe the inputs and outputs below. Similar to the previous problems, we parametrize a low-dimensional projected subspace of wave episodes using a Karhunen Loève series expansion [10, 11] of the stochastic surface waves, described by a power spectral density such as the JONSWAP spectrum. We next use the proprietary code LAMP (Large Amplitude Motion Program, v4.0.9, May 2019) [12] in order to calculate the forward problem of specific VBM response to a"
